# Entity Framework Core - Course Description

This course covers the fundamentals of working with databases using Entity Framework Core (EF Core), an Object-Relational Mapping (ORM) framework for .NET. Participants will learn how to integrate EF Core into .NET applications, perform CRUD operations, manage relationships, use migrations, and optimize performance.

## Topics

### Introduction to Entity Framework Core
- Understanding Object-Relational Mapping (ORM)
- Setting up and configuring Entity Framework Core in .NET projects

### Creating and Managing Models
- Defining entities and models
- Using data annotations for validation
- Configuring models using Fluent API

### CRUD Operations
- Performing Create, Read, Update, Delete (CRUD) operations with EF Core
- Using DbContext for interacting with the database
- Handling entity state (Added, Modified, Deleted)

### Relationships
- Defining and managing relationships between entities (one-to-many, many-to-many, etc.)
- Using navigation properties and foreign keys
- Cascade delete and change tracking

### Migrations
- Creating and applying migrations to modify the database schema
- Rolling back and reapplying migrations
- Managing database versioning

### Querying Data
- Writing LINQ queries with EF Core
- Using eager, lazy, and explicit loading
- Filtering, sorting, and projecting data

### Performance Optimization
- Using asynchronous operations to improve performance
- Query performance tuning and optimization techniques
- Caching strategies and query execution plans

### Advanced Features
- Working with raw SQL queries
- Handling concurrency in EF Core
- Customizing query behavior and intercepting queries

### Testing and Debugging
- Writing unit tests for EF Core-based applications
- Debugging and logging EF Core queries

## Skills Acquired
- Using Entity Framework Core in .NET applications
